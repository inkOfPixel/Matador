A bold interface that helps you monitor your [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) queues.

Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks).

```bash
$ npx create-remix@latest --template nullndr/matador
```

# What's in the stack

- Matador interface at `/matador` route
- A little [utility](https://github.com/nullndr/Matador/tree/main/app/queues) that helps you build your queues
- Styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

## Development

- Start the Redis Database with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

  > ℹ️ we use the latest version of Docker that already includes compose, not docker-compose

  ```bash
  $ npm run dev:docker
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```bash
  $ npm run dev
  ```

If you want to stop the development Redis Database, run `npm run dev:docker:stop`

# Connecting to your Redis server

Matador needs a **Redis 6 instance** at least to work.

Set your redis connection string as the `REDIS_URL` env variable in your `.env` file.

# Testing

## Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client.

## Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

## Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript.
It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting that is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

## Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project.
It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save.
There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.

# What if I already have a project with BullMQ?

We're planning to give you a simple script that will copy only the route and it's library.
